                            Today almost every business has moved to the web partially
                            or fully, which means that businesses not only compete in the 
                            real world but in the virtual world also. 
                            A successfull business stands out when it provide seamless and unique
                            online experience compared to its competitors.
                            Designs can make or break a business. Websites that i design and
                            develop follow the recent tried and tested design trends so that 
                            you remain on top over your competition.

                        <p>Today we have tons of different screen sizes, 
                            which means we have to support and display
                            our website properly on all of them. This is 
                            called responsiveness. And it's not an easy job 
                            to do so. But as a web developer i have mastered
                            this skill and all the websites that i make and made
                            all are responsive.

                        <h2>Fast and performant</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card__description">
                        <p>People use different kinds of devices which differ in performance due 
                            to the underlying architecture and constraints. For example mobile devices
                            don't have that level of performance compared to desktops or laptops as they
                            priortize battery life over performance. A website must be fast and lightwieght
                            to handle all such situtations without hogging on cpu resources and slowing
                            down which leads to increase bounce rate and less retention time.
                            I always follow the best practices in web dev world so that the website 
                            works the same across the devices and within the constraints of the device.
